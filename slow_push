# For very large repos, it may not be possible to push everything to
# Github all at once because of limits on the pack size. (If my
# understanding is correct, the git protocol first figures out all the
# objects that the source repo has the the destination needs, given
# what you're trying to push and then packs them into a single file
# called a pack file which it then sends to the destination. And
# there's a limit on how big those files can be. This script avoids
# that limit by pushing one ref at a time, reading their names from
# standard in.
#
# If, for instance, you have made a monorepo out of a bunch of other
# repos, you could push the main branch of each sub-repo separately as
# each sub-repo is likely small enough to be pushed in one go.
